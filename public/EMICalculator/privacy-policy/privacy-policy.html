						Hire-You website in order to serve advertisements to you on Hire-You
						website or other websites with which we have a business relationship. We may also aggregate on
						an anonymous basis data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other
						information relevant to the job search or competition among job seekers for any such job. Such
						aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or
						fellow job seekers or community members. We disclose information to companies and individuals we
						employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web servers, data,
						providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.
						These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as may necessary
						to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.

				<h4 class="title">Policy For Private Resume Database Hosting</h4>
				<p>Global Job provides a variety of services related to hosting private databases and using certain
					website applications in
					connection with such databases. These hosted databases are hosted by Global Job, but Global Job does
					not own the data in
					them or submitted to our applications. Such databases may contain personal information about
					individuals, including
					candidates for employment and existing employees of our customers. This data may include contact
					details, work history,
					educational history, work preferences, and other data, depending on the particular customer and
					application. In some
					instances, it may include personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). Global Job
					provides hosting space
					to customers who own these databases and utilize our applications on such data. Global Job conducts
					its activities
					strictly in accordance with customer instructions and pursuant to contractual arrangements with
					them. Customers act as
					data controllers with respect to all such hosted databases. The data in these databases, including
					any submitted to our
					applications, is subject to the customer's privacy policies. If you are a candidate for employment
					with one of our
					customers, refer to the customer's Terms & Conditions / Privacy Page on their career site to
					understand the terms and
					privacy practices that apply to your data. For accessing and reviewing your personal information,
					contact our customer
					with any such requests. We will cooperate with customer requests to assist with responses. Global
					Job
					is not responsible
					for its customers' privacy policies or practices.</p>
				<h4 class="title">An Important Note about Your Resume</h4>
				<p>Global Job gives you the option to place your resume in our database. You can control the status of
					your resume by
					setting it to private or public. Storing your resume in our database, but not allowing it to be
					searchable by potential
					employers or recruiters means you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters
					will not have
					access to search it through our resume database product.</p>
				<p>If you set your resume as private, it is not searchable by potential employers or others with access
					to our resume
					database. You may still use your resume to apply online to a job with a private resume. If you apply
					online to a job,
					your resume will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy.</p>
				<p>If you set your resume as public, but want your contact information to be confidential, your resume
					will be searchable
					by potential employers, but Global Job will hide your contact information and current company. You
					must also remove your
					contact information from your uploaded or copied text resume. Note that even without your contact
					details, it may be
					possible for you to be identified if you have a rare skill or job title. If concerned about being
					identified, do not
					include specific details that could identify you. If you use a confidential resume to apply to a job
					online, the
					employer to whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information to contact you
					about your
					application. </p>
				<p>Allowing your resume to be searchable without making it confidential means all parties with access to
					our searchable
					resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. Employers or other parties with
					access to our
					searchable resume database may be located in countries whose data protection legislation may not be
					equivalent to the
					laws in your country. By making your resume searchable, you expressly consent to such transfers of
					data.</p>
				<p>Global Job attempts to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as
					paying employers,
					recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, human resource professionals, law enforcement, and
					national security agencies.
					We cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the
					use made of resumes
					by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove
					your resume from our
					searchable database at any time; details on how to do this are given below. However, employers,
					recruiters, and others
					who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to
					the database, may have
					retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. Global Job will take reasonable
					steps
					to ensure that
					parties other than those mentioned above will not, without consent, gain access to this database.
					However, Global Job is
					not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes by any third parties. We cannot
					control the retention,
					use, or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly, do
					not put sensitive
					information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public in your
					resume.</p>
				<p>Global Job attempts to limit access to our resume and profile database to legitimate users, but
					cannot
					guarantee that
					other parties will not gain access to this database. Once your resume has been disclosed, Global Job
					is not able to
					retrieve it from the third parties who accessed it. Accordingly, do not put sensitive information,
					personality profiles,
					or other information you would not want made public in your resume or profile.</p>
				<p>If you provide us with details of a reference, ensure that the person is aware that you have
					forwarded their details and
					has consented in writing for you to do so.</p>
				<p>If you use our facilities to build a resume or post a resume in our database of job seekers' resumes,
					you will be
					providing us with personal data that we will use in accordance with this statement. Your resume must
					not contain
					sensitive data related to your racial or ethnic origin, political beliefs, philosophical or
					religious beliefs,
					membership of a trade union or political party, physical or mental health, genetic makeup,
					addictions, sexual life, the
					commission of criminal offenses or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or any social
					security number or
					national identification number, unless you have previously sent us your written consent to process
					your sensitive
					personal data, if Global Job determines this to be a requirement of applicable law. If your resume
					does contain such data
					and you set your resume as public, then you agree that we may retain this information and use it in
					accordance with this
					statement. We cannot control third parties' access to such information from our searchable database.
